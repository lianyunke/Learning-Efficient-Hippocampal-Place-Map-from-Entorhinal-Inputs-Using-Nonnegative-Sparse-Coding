# This MATLAB code implements the model described in the paper "Learning an Efficient Hippocampal Place Map from Entorhinal Inputs Using Non-Negative Sparse Coding"

This paper is available https://www.eneuro.org/content/8/4/ENEURO.0557-20.2021

Run main.m to learn the place map using entorhinal cells, either grid cells or weakly spatial cells
